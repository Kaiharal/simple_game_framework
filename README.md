## Overview

**Project Title**:
Can you do it (Too!)
**Project Description**:
my friends had some kind of obsession with my last, very much low effort mobile app, for some reason. they pushed for me to create... a sequel, leading to this. I'm honestly mostly confused, but they seem to be loving it, so...

it's functional for now, but knowing my friends, they'll probably ask for more features later, haha.
